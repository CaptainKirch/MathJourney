Welcome to where I am going to be sharing everything I learn about mathematics.

I have a about a middle school level understanding of math and my goal is to become a top 1% AI Quant Developer in the future.

I have a lot of work to do. I am starting off with Pre Algebra and working my way into Calculus and much more....

I will be sharing my notes here in this repo every single week to document when I have learnt a new concept or to share exercises I am working on to improve my skills.

Enjoy.
